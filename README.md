Open Constructive System

## Open Design Declaration

LEVO was once a start-up aimed at delivering open source structures to the community. Maybe ahead of time and without investment, we saw that makers needed a percentage of high quality re-usable structural tools, that would complement digital fabrication.
Now the project is hosted at DAR - DesignAdvancedResources.org a non profit aimed at Open Design Promotion and development.
We are looking for collaboration, early adopters and left with a considerable ammount of material to redistribute for projects that will help develop this idea and ethos.
